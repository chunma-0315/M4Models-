First, using the STM model to get the daily slurry temperature requires the following information: 
local daily weather conditions (air temperature and radiation), slurry tank diameter and Slurry levels  
Then, using the CH4 model to calculate daily CH4 emissions with the inputs of slurry temperature, lnA', kgVS/year, Ea, TOC/VS and CH4/(CH4+CO2)
